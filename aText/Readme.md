To use this group of snippets
==============================
- Open aText
- Data > Import data > load_the_given_Latex.csv
- Click on the Latex Group.
- Expand: At "Expand abbreviation" hotkey.
- Go to Preferences > Hotkeys.
  + Go to the Expand abbreviation.
  + Select Shift.
  + Press tab for the last box with.
  
  
  Caveats:
  ============
  - If we make only tab as the hotkey, we can not use tab as a regular key in makefile and other cases. 
  - So make shift-tab as the hotkey.
  - I have already my snippets for Atom editor. So disable aText all groups for Atom.
